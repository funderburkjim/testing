<h2>Help for the Stchoupak Dictionary Scan web page</h2>
<p>The dictionary is the 
<a href='/scans/STCScan/STCScanjpg/stchou-vor0001.jpg'>
Sanskrit-French Dictionary</a> by
N. Stchoupak, L. Nitti, and L. Renou, published 1932.
</p>
<p>Enter a word in the citation field, and press the 
<strong>return</strong> key  to display the entry. The first dictionary entry 
is shown
whose beginning matches what is typed; if the first entry is not
matched exactly, the full spelling of what is matched is shown in bold
below the word entered.  A page number (from 1 to 982) may be entered
instead of a word.
</p>
<p>
 Below the entry appears a list of the headwords for the page retrieved.
These are split into two columns corresponding to the columns on the page.
Each word is clickable, and highlights the particular word within the
scanned image.
</p>
<p>To the right, the scanned image of the page is shown, with the matched word
highlighted; the page  is scrolled so that the highlighted word is
visible. 
</p>
<p>In the upper left of the display of the page, the '<strong>&lt;</strong>' 
and '<strong>&gt;</strong>' characters
 may be clicked to go to the preceding or following pages of the 
dictionary.
</p>
<p> The web page was developed using the Firefox 3.0 browser in the Windows XP
operating system.  Limited testing indicates that all features work 
satisfactorily with the IE7 and Google Chrome browsers in Windows XP, and
the Safari browser on Macintosh (X10.4).
</p>

<p> By default, the input word is to be entered in the HK (Harvard-Kyoto) transliteration,
and the output list of words appears in Unicode Devanagari.  The selection
menus offer other choices for both input and output. The 
<a href='/monier/help.html'>Help</a> page for the Monier-Williams display
discusses these choices.

A Google Docs spreadsheet has been made for checking the Perseus Links for the Greek in MW.

@jmigliori @gasyoun You should be able to edit the spreadsheet 

Here is a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14dilSv7gS-1jeR-cm4dsFsUUp6r_GdRzXuMHGfuc03E/edit?usp=sharing) that anyone can use to view.
If anyone else wants to work on this, let me know your gmail address.

The primary idea is to try the perseus link, see if it leads to a useful result. 
*  If link is ok, Change the `Perseus Status` from  `Todo` to `OK` --- 
   These are Cases that don't require further attention from Jonathan
* If link is not useful, Change the `Perseus Status` from  `Todo` to `Problem` --- 
   These are Cases that require further attention from Jonathan.
   If you are Jonathan, you can fill in the last column to a 'good' Perseus Link.  It is
   requested that you use BETA here.

This is the first use of a Google Sheet for this kind of work. I chose it since it was
easier to create than creating a database update php application. 
Do others think this is useful enough to carry though for this task?

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
@jmigliori   While doing several of the cases in the above spreadsheet by hand, I noticed that some Perseus links return with the phrase 'Sorry, no information found for ...'.

Using the Python requests module, I wrote a program to call the Perseus link for all the cases, and to filter
out those with the 'Sorry...' phrase returned.  These are presumably the cases that could use the attention
of a Greek expert to provide an alternate query spelling.   Tomorrow, I'll modify the spreadsheet so these
cases can be identified.  Probably, the other Perseus links are acceptable.

Out of the 1127 cases in the spreadsheet, 251 are Problems in that they return 
the 'Sorry, no information found' message.

Note: The PHP curl library could be used to do what the Python requests module does.

@funderburkjim Google Sheet is a good enough solution and it's good, because it's quick to make one. 251 / 1127 with scripts is great news, because I'm too lazy to work with Greek while there are still hundreds of unsolved Sanskrit issues :last_quarter_moon_with_face: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
@jmigliori   I see that you've done a few.  I like the way the spreadsheet permits you to make comments.

Today I reloaded all the ones after row 71,  premarking the 'Sorry, No Information' ones as 'Problem'.  It's 
probably safe for you to just restrict attention to these.

Also, I added a 'Solved' option to the 'Status field', so that when you solve a 'Problem', you can change the
status to 'Solved'.    I did that on a few that you worked on, but left a couple as 'Problem' because I wasn't sure.  

Does this Google Sheet format work ok for you?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sounds good.

Yes, I'm happy with how this Google Sheet works.

@gasyoun  One 'feature' I noticed regarding the Google Sheet.  When I download the sheet to tsv (tab-separated-values) form,
something happens to the way the hyperlink cells appear in the downloaded tsv.   Only the 'display text' appears,  the associated url (and the hyperlink function itself) are not shown.

For instance one of the cells has the content:
```
=HYPERLINK("http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?la=greek&l=E%29%2FXI-S","E)/XI-S")
```
but when downloaded, only `E)/XI-S` is shown.

Is this usually the way spreadsheets work when you convert them to csv or tsv format (e.g. with Excel)?  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
@funderburkjim the problem is that formulas are lost when documents are downloaded from Google Docs. They get broken, it was always so. Such is life.

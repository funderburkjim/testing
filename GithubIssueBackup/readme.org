The readIssue.py program provides a copy of the issues and issue comments
 for a particular repository.
 Only the 'body' of the issue and comments are saved.
This program usess the Python 'requests' module, which must be
installed separately. (search 'Python requests', OR, if you have already
installed pip, just 'pip install requests' to install this, OR , do this
in a Python virtualenv.)


 
Here is the command line to retrieve issues 1-11 of the GreekInSanskrit
repository owned by the sanskrit-lexicon Github project.
Each issue is put into a file named issue_<issue-num> in the greekcomments
directory (which is created via mkdir greekcomments).

python readIssue.py 1,11  sanskrit-lexicon GreekInSanskrit greekcomments

A given issue_# file is formatted into sections separated by a string of
72 hyphens.
The first section has one line, and is the url of the issue.
The second section is the body of the issue statement.
Subsequent sections contain the bodies of the issue comments.


Comment:  A slight improvement to the program would format the
number in the file name to the same size, so file listing will be in
issue order  (e.g., issue_01 instead of issue_1).

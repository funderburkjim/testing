This Hitopadesa (the work inculcating salutary instruction) when studied (lit., carefully attended to) gives (the student) proficiency in elegant speeches, a variety of expression in every department and a knowledge of the conduct of human affairs.

A wise man should think of (acquiring) knowledge and money as though he were not subject to old age or death: but he should perform his religious duties as if Death had seized him by the hair.
; 0053
Learning, of all things, (the wise) declare to be without a superior (the best of them all ), because of its incapability of being taken away, or valued or exhausted.
; 0055
Learning, although possessed by a low man, introduces him to the king who is (ordinarily) inapproachable, just as a river, although flowing through a low region, takes one to the inaccessible sea : (sources) from which floweth great fortune (or, the future rests with fortune).
; 0057
Learning endows one with modesty ; from (having) modesty one passes on to (gets) worthiness ; being worthy one obtains riches ; from riches religious merit and from that happiness.

The knowledge of arms and that of the Sastras - these two lores conduce to glory: but the former exposes one to ridicule in old age, while the latter is ever respected.

As an impression made upon a raw (earthen or so) pot can undergo no change afterwards -- so (following the same principle) in this work the science of conduct (or policy) is taught to youths under the guise of stories.

On the bank of the Bhagirathi there is a city named Pataliputra. In it there was a king, Sudarshana by name,

endowed with all princely qualities. That king once heard a couple of Slokas (stanzas) chanted by some one ; (viz.)

He who does not possess (a knowledge of) Sastra, the universal eye, which totally removes various doubts and discusses things hidden from view, is surely blind.

Youth, abundance of wealth, sovereignty and inconsiderateness are the source of calamity even singly; what then, where all these four are combined !
; 0073
On hearing this, the king, who was distracted at heart, on account of the non-attendance to (the commands of the) Sastras of his sons who had no knowledge of the Sastras and who always followed the wrong path, thought to himself:
; 0075
What is the good of (what benefit can accrue from) having a son who is neither learned nor pious (dutiful); (for) what is the use of an eye that is blind? It simply causes occular pain.
; 0077
Of sons, not born, (born and) dead and foolish, the first two are to be preferred and not the last: (for) the first two cause pain (but) once ; the last at every step. Moreover,

He is (really) born by whose birth the family is exalted. In this revolving world who does not die and is not born again?

If the mother of the boy, for whom the little finger does not bend down hastily at the commencement of the enumeration of the number of meritorious men, be said to have given birth to a son, then say, what a barren woman would be like to (i.e., she is as good as a barren woman).
; 0092
He, who is not well known for his charity, penance, bravery, learning and the acquisition of wealth, is but the excrement of his mother. Also,
; 0095
It is better to have one meritorious son than a hundred of foolish ones; the single moon dispels darkness; and not the whole firmament of stars.
; 0097
The son of him, who has practised religious austerities, extremely difficult to perform, at some holy place, will be obedient, prosperous, righteous and talented.
; 0100
An influx of money, constant health (lit., freedom from disease), a beloved wife, and one sweet-speaking (of gentle manners), an obedient son, and learning productive of wealth -- these six, o king, are the pleasures of the mortal world.

A father who contracts debts (i.e., leaves nothing to his son but a legacy of debt) is an enemy, and so is a mother, false to her bed; a beautiful wife is an enemy; and such is an illiterate son.

Learning if not kept up by constant study is poison ; taking food after indigestion is poison; to a poor man a public assembly is poison; and to an old man a youthful wife is poison.

A man of merits, born of whatevor parents, is honoured ; (for) what is the use of a bow that is without string though made of a faultless bamboo staff (or, what can a man of pure Kshatriya extraction do if wanting in martial vigour)?

Alas! poor child, thou, who leadest an easy life, didst not acquire knowledge in these (bygone) nights, on this account dost thou come to grief (fare ill) in the society of the learned like a cow stuck in mud.

Then how shall I now make my sons accomplished ! For: --

Food, sleep, fear and the enjoyment of carnal pleasures -- these men share in common with beasts ; surely the sense (or performance) of duty is their special attribute (distinguishing mark): devoid of this they are degraded to the level of (stand on a level with) beasts.

The life of him, who has not achieved any one of Dharma (the discharge of religious duties), Artha (the acquisition of money by fair means), Kama (the gratification of desires so as not to trespass on Dharma) and final emancipation, is as without its purpose (useless) as that of the nipple on the neck of a she-goat.

(The period of) life, (the kinds of) action (one has to perform), (the amount of) wealth (to be acquired), (the degree of) knowledge (to be attained), and (the time of) death -- even these five are created (determined) while a man is yet in the womb. And that,

Even thinking fate to be favourable one should not give up one's industry ; (for) one can never get oil from sesamum without exertion. Moreover,

Fortune approaches him, the lion among men, who is industrious. It is the weak-minded who say "Fate gives". Dismissing all idea about (lit., killing) fate, put forth manly efforts depending upon your own strength; and if, after an exertion is made, success attend not, where is the blame (i.e., you are not to blame; or, find out where the fault lay)?

 Just as a chariot can not move with one wheel, so without manly exertion, fate does not succeed. And further,

What is called fate is (but) the (sum of one's) actions in a previous life; one should, therefore, make an effort manfully without being slothful.

Having thus meditated the king convened a council of the learned. The King said -- Ye Pandits, listen. Is there such a learned man among you, as is able to make my sons who are always going astray and who are ignorant of the Sastras, undergo a second birth (as it were) by giving them instruction in the science of conduct? For,

A piece of glass, by being in contact with gold, possesses the lustre of emerald ; similarly a fool attains proficiency by being in the company of the good. It is also said --
; 0165
The intellect is impaired, O friend, by the society of inferiors; it remains what it is with one's equals and is improved by association with one's superiors.
; 0167
Then a great Pandit, Visnusharman by name, who knew all the principles of the Science of conduct (or, who knew the very essence of the entire science of conduct) spoke like a second Brihaspati -- My lord, these princes are born of an exalted race. They are, therefore, capable of being instructed by me in the Nitishastra. For,
; line 0171
No action exercised upon an unfit object can bear fruit: a crane cannot be taught (to speak) like a parrot even with hundreds of efforts. And this other thing,
In this (royal) family a child devoid of merits cannot be born; whence can a piece of glass be produced in a mine of rubies ? 
[Page 5]
; line 0176
I will, therefore, make your sons well versed in the Nitishastra within the space of six months. The king spoke again respectfully --
; line 0178
Even an insect ascends the head of the good by being in contact with flowers; a stone also attains divinity when well consecrated by the great. Moreover,
; line 0181
As objects on the rising mountain appear bright by the near presence of the sun, so a person of humble rank too shines by being in the company of the good.
; line 0183
Merits pass as merits with those who know how to appreciate them: coming in contact with one devoid of merits they are turned into faults. Rivers, as they rise, have their water sweet, but on reaching the sea they cease to be drinkable.

I, therefore, give you Carte blanche as regards giving instruction to my sons in the science of conduct. Having said so the king entrusted his sons to Vishnusharman with great respect.

Now as the princes were sitting at ease on the terrace of their palace the Pandit said before them by way of introduction --

I will, therefore, relate, for your diversion, the wonderful tale of the crow, the tortoise and others. The princes said -- Sir, tell it. Vishnusharman said -- Listen. I now begin Mitralabha of which the following is the introductory verse.

Though destitute of means and without wealth, the crow, the tortoise, the deer and the mouse, who were the best of friends and gifted with intellect quickly accomplished their purposes.

The princes asked "How was this ?" Vishnusharma related --

There is, on the bank of the Godavari, a large silk-cotton tree. There, coming from regions in different quarters, birds were wont to roost at night. Once, when the night was almost spent, and the divine Moon, lord of the night-lotus, was pending on the crest of the setting mountain, a crow, Laghupatanaka (Swift-flier) by name, who was awake, saw a fowler advancing like a second god of death. Seeing him he reflected "To-day I have had an unwelcome sight in the early morning. I know not what evil it forebodes." Saying so he set out, much disturbed at heart, following up his (the fowler's) course. For,

Now the hunter, having scattered the grains of rice, spread out his net, and himself remained concealed. Just at that time a king of pigeons, Chitragriva (the Speckle-necked) by name, who was sailing in the sky with his retinue, noticed the grains of rice. Then the pigeon-king said to the pigeons that were attracted by the grains of rice -- Whence can there be the possibility of rice-grains being found in this lonely (tenantless) forest? So let the matter be first carefully examined. I do not see any good will come out of this.
Probably, by this our desire for the rice-grains, we too shall fare similarly (meet with a fate similar) to that of --

Once while roaming in the southern forest I saw -- A certain old tiger, having bathed and taken Kusa grass in his paw, used to address (the passers by sitting) on the margin of a lake (thus) -- "Ho, ho, travellers, take this gold bracelet." Then a certain traveller, attracted by greed, thought to himself -- This happens by good luck. But I must not proceed in a matter where there is personal risk. For,

Although a desired object be obtained from an undesirable source, the result is not good ; even nectar (or sweet-food), which is contaminated with poison, leads to death.
But an attempt to get wealth is in every case, attended with peril. And it is said in connection with this --

Without embarking upon an adventure a man does not see good fortune ; but if he does embark upon it and lives (survives it), he sees it.

Let me therefore carefully see it. He said aloud -- "Where is thy bracelet?" The tiger stretched forth bis paw and showed it. The traveller said - How am I to trust thee who art ferocious ? The tiger replied -- Listen, O traveller. Formerly, indeed, in the days of youth, I was extremely wicked. On account of my slaughter of many a cow and man, my sons and wife perishod ; and I am without issue. I was then advised by a holy man to practice charity and do such other holy deeds. Following his counsel, I am now in the habit of bathing and giving gifts ; I am old and have lost my nails and teeth ; how can I not be an object of confidence then! For,

Therefore, bathe in this lake and accept this gold bracelet. Thereupon, placing confidence in his words, no sooner did the traveller enter the lake for bathing than he stuck in deep mud and was unable to run away. The tiger seeing him plunged into the mire said -- Ha, thou art fallen into deep mud. I will lift thee out of it. Saying so he approached him gently : and the traveller being seized by the tiger reflected --

That he reads the texts of religious law or studies the Vedas, is no reason why confidence should be reposed in a villain : it is the nature that predominate in such a case : just as by nature the milk of cows is sweet.

I, therefore, did not do well in that I placed confidence in

The mouse quickly proceeded to sever the bonds of Chitragriva. Chirtagriva said -- Friend, do not do so; first cut the bonds of these my followers ; and then you will cut mine. Hiranyaka too replied -- I have little strength and my teeth are delicate, how then can I gnaw asunder the snares of these all? So as long as my teeth are not broken, I will cut your bonds and then sever those of the rest too as far as my strength will allow. Chitragriva said -- Be it so; but cut the bonds of these to the best of your strength. Hiranyaka replied -- The protection of dependents at the cost of one's life is not approved of by those conversant with the science of conduct (or, policy). For,

Now the crow Laghupatanaka, the witness of the whole affair, said this in astonishment: Ho, Hiranyaka, you are

;hitoeng014.txt


praiseworthy. I, therefore, desire friendship with you. Kindly then favour me with your friendship. On hearing this, Hiranyaka asked from within his hole -- who are you? He said I am a crow, Laghupatanaka by name. Hiranyaka smilingly observed -- What friendship can there be with you ? For,

Whatever is fit to be united with another, in this world, the same a wise man should unite with that: I am the food and you the feeder: how can love (friendship) exist between us? And again,
; line 0453
Friendship between the food and its eater is simply the cause of misfortune: the deer that was caught in a snare, through (the stratagem of) a jackal was delivered by a crow. The crow asked -- How was that ? Hiranyaka related -- :

FABLE II. 
; line 0458
There is, in the country of Magadha, a vast wilderness, called Champakavati. In it there long lived in great friendship a deer and a crow. The deer, plump and sleek in body, was spied by a certain jackal, while roaming at will. On seeing him, the jackal said to himself -- Ah, how shall I come by his delicious flesh ! Well, let me first create confidence (in him). Having thus reflected, he went up to him and said -- Friend, is it all well with you? The dear asked -- Who are you? He replied -- I am a jackal, Kshudrabuddhi (Little-wit) by name. I live here, like one dead, having lost all my relatives. Now that I have found a friend in you and have (thus) a relative, I have once more entered the world of the living. Now I will, in every way, be your attendant. The deer said -- Be it so. Thereafter, when the divine Sun, the wearer of a wreath of rays, had set, the two went to the residence of the deer. There on the branch of a Champaka tree, lived a crow, named Subuddbi (Good-wit), an old friend of the deer. Seeing the two the crow asked -- Friend, who is this second ? The deer said -- This is a jackal who comes here desiring our friendship. The crow said, friend, friendship, all of a sudden, with a stranger, is not advisable. For it is said -- 
; line 0475
Shelter should not be given to any one whose family and disposition are not known; for the fault of a cat, the vulture, Jaradgava, suffered death.
The two asked how it was, whereupon the crow related --

FABLE III. 
; line 0480
There is a large Parkati tree on the hill, named Gridhrakut (the peak of Vultures), on the bank of the Bhagirathi,

;hitoeng015.txt


In its hollow dwelt, with his talons and eyes gone through an adverse turn of fate, a vulture, Jaradgava by name. Now, out of pity, the birds, roosting in the tree, spared small portions from their food and gave them to him. He lived on that and 
[Page 13]
 looked after the young birds. Now, once a cat, named
; line 0485
Dirghakarna (the long-eared) came there to eat the youngs of the birds. Seeing him coming, the nestlings being terror-stricken, raised a cry. Hearing it Jaradgava asked -- Who is this that is coming? Dirghakarna, seeing the vulture, said in alarm -- Alas, it is all up with me. However,
One should dread a danger only as long as it has not arrived; but seeing that the danger has come, a man should do what the occasion demands,
; line 0491
Now that I am in his presence, I cannot run away. So let things take what course they may. I will first create confidence in him and then approach him. Thus resolved, he went forth and said -- Sir, I salute you. The Vulture asked -- Who are you? He replied -- A cat. The Vulture said -- Get away, else I shall have to kill you. The cat said -- In the first place, hear me, and then, if you deem me to be worthy of death, let me not live. For,
; line 0499
Is any one killed or honoured merely because he belongs to a particular caste? It is only on one's actions (conduct) being fully known that one is found fit to merit death or respect.
; line 0501
The Vulture said –- Explain why you have come here. The cat replied -- I dwell here on the bank of the Ganges, bathing every day, living a life of celibacy and practising the vow of Chandrayana. All birds, worthy of confidence, always declare before me that you are devoted to the study of religious law. Hence did I come here to hear from you, who are advanced both in knowledge and years (lit. old both as regards krowledge and age), the holy law. But your honour is so well versed in that law that you are ready to kill me, a guest. While the duty of a house-holder is this --
; line 0508
Fitting hospitality should be shown even to a foe coming to the house: the tree withdraws not its shade from its cutter.
; line 0510
And if there be no wealth, a guest should be honoured with kind words at least. For,
; line 0512
Grass (a seat made of grass), place, water and the fourth (thing), agreeable speech, these, at any rate, are never refused in the house of the good. Moreover,

Fire is the object of worship to the twice-born (Brahmanas), and the Brahmana to the (four) castes; the husband is the only object of adoration to his wife, while a guest is the object of reverence everywhere.

 When a guest turns back from a man's house, disappointed in his hopes, he does so, having transferred his sin to him and taken his merit with him. And again,

Even a low-born person, coming to the house of one of a high caste, should be honoured as he deserves ; (for) a guest represents in himself all the gods.
; line 0526
The vulture said –- The cat is fond of flesh; and the youngs of birds live here: therefore, I say so. The cat, on hearing this, touched the ground and then his ears and said I having learnt the code of religious ordinances and being free from passion have undertaken this arduous vow of the Moon. Although the religious texts disagree with one another (in other respects) they are quite at one in this that abstinence from killing is the highest religious duty. For,
; line 0532
Those men, who are averse to all sort of killing, who bear all things and who are the refuge of all, go to heaven.
; line 0535
Religious merit is the only friend who follows one even in death: everything else goes to destruction along with the body. Moreover,
; line 0538
When one eats the flesh of another, mark the difference between the two -- the one enjoys momentary pleasure; while the other loses his life. Besides,

Who will commit great sin for this accursed belly when it can be filled with herbs growing spontaneously in the forest?
; line 0546
Having thus inspired confidence (in the vulture) the cat abode in the hollow of the tree.
Thereafter, as days passed on, he attacked the young birds, brought them into the hollow and devoured them every day. (Now) an inquiry was set on foot by those birds whose young nestlings were eaten and who being sorrow-stricken were

;hitoeng017.txt

lamenting. On perceiving this, the cat slipped out of the hollow and escaped. After that, the birds, who were making a close search here and there, discovered the bones of their nestling in the hollow of the tree. Then all the birds having come to the conclusion - our young ones have been eaten by this very Jaradgava -- put him to death. Therefore, I say -- "To one of unknown family and disposition &c." On hearing this the jackal said angrily -- On the day the deer saw you first, your honour too was one whose family and disposition were not known. How comes it then that this friendly behaviour towards you is gaining strength day by day?

Just as the deer is my friend, so are you too. The deer said -- What is the use of this altercation? Let us all live happily together in friendly discourse. For,

The crow said -- Be it so. Then in the morning, they all went to places where their will led them.
; line 0567
Once the jackal said to the deer in solitude -- Friend, in a corner of this wood there is a field full of corn. I shall take you there and show it to you. That being done, the deer went there every day and ate the corn. Now, the master of the field observed this and set a snare. Then the deer going there again was caught into the snare; whereapon he reflected -- Who but a friend can deliver me from the hunter's snare as from the snare of Death? Presently the jackal came up and standing near reflected -- As to the success of my wish, it has borne fruit by my well-arranged scheme. When he will be cut up, I am sure to get his bones covered with flesh and blood which will serve me as food plentifully. The deer, delighted at his sight, said,
; line 0579
Friend, cut my bonds at once ; quickly save me. For,

Friend, if you will not think otherwise (i.e. will not have any misconception about me) tomorrow morning I will do whatever you will bid me do.

With these words, he concealed himself near him and remained (waiting).
; 0589
 Afterwards the crow, seeing that the deer did not return in the evening, looked for him here and there, and having discovered him in that condition, said -- Friend, what is this? The deer replied –- This is the result of my disregard of a friend's advice. For, it is said
; 0592
Adversity stands close to him who listens not to the words of well-meaning friends: such a man is the delight of his enemies.

The crow asked -- Where is that traitor? The deer said -- Desirous of my flesh he waits just here. The crow said I had already said (as much).
; 0597
"I have committed no fault" -- this is no reason for putting confidence (in a wicked man) : for, even the meritorious have fear from the wicked.

He who defeats one's object in one's absence and speaks sweetly in one's presence -- such a friend one should avoid, like a vessel fall of poison with milk at the surface.
; 0603
Then the crow, having heaved a deep sigh, said -- Ah villain, what hast thou done in acting so wickedly ? For,
; 0605
What (glory or credit) is there in deceiving supplicants, in this world, who are made to converse (with you) by using sweet words, who are won over by false attentions, and who (thereby) entertain hopes and have placed confidence in you)?
; 0610
O divine Earth, how dost thou bear (on thy surface) that man, treacherous to his promise, who practises evil upon a benevolent, unsuspecting (lit., full of confidence) and simple-hearted person ?

;hitoeng019.txt
; 0613
One should not form friendship or feel affection for a wicked man: a charcoal, when alive, burns; when cold, it soils the hand.
; 0614
Or rather, such is the settled course of conduct of the wicked.
; 0615
First he falls at the feet and then bites the back; gradually he sings wonderfully some sweet indistinct hum into the ear; and having noticed some hole (a weak point) he at once enters it (takes advantage of it) fearlessly : -(thus) does a gnat imitate all the actions of wicked man.
; 0620
That a wicked man speaks sweetly is no reason why confidence should be reposed in him : (for) on the tip of his tongue there is honey, but in his heart the deadliest poison.
; 0622
Then at dawn, the crow observed the owner of the field coming towards the place, stick in hand. On seeing him the crow said -- Friend deer, feign yourself dead, fill your belly with wind and so remain, with your legs stiffened. When I make a noise, you shall get up and bound off quickly.
; 0627
Following the advice of the crow, the deer stood in that posture. Now the master of the field saw the deer in that condition, his eyes beaming with joy. Saying "Ah, thou art dead of thyself", he released him from confinement and was busied in collecting his nets. Then hearing the sound of the crow, the deer quickly got up and ran away, while the jackal was killed by the stick flung at him (the deer) by the owner of the field. For it is said
; 0634
In three years, or three months, or three fortnights, or (even) in three days, a man reaps the fruit of his good or bad actions when reaching their extreme.
; 0636
Hence I say "Friendship between the victim and the eater &c." The crow observed again,
; 0639
Even though I eat you I shall not get ample food; but if you live, I live, O sinless one, like Chitragriva. Again,
; 0642
Confidence (in one another) is observed even amongst those lower animals whose actions are invariably (wholly) good : for the disposition of the good ever remains true to (lit. does not vary from) their inborn goodness. Moreover,
; 0645
The mind of a good man, although made to fly into a great passion, is not affected (by anger); it is not possible to heat the water of the sea with a torch of straw.

Hiranyaka said -- You are fickle-minded (or, mischievous); and, with the fickle-minded, friendship should not at all be formed. For it is said
; 0649
A cat, a buffalo, a ram, a crow, and a bad man -- these get the upper hand (get the better of as) through confidence : confidence in them is out of place (lit. it is not proper to put trust in them).
Another consideration is this -- you belong to the side of our enemies. And thus says the precept --
; 0653
One should not make peace with an enemy even by a compactly-formed treaty: water, although greatly heated, does extinguish fire. Nevertheless,
; 0655
A wicked man should be shunned although he be adorned with learning; the cobra is decked with a gem : but is he not dreadful?
; 0657
What is impossible can never be possible; and what is possible is certainly possible: a cart cannot move on water nor can a boat on land. Moreover,
; 0660
He, who, depending upon the strength of wealth (given to or by his enemies), although great, trusts to his enemies or to wives that have ceased to love him, finds his life end there.
; 0662
Laghupatanaka said I have heard everything. Yet I am thus far resolved that I must necessarily form friendship with you: or else I will destroy myself by starvation. For,
; 0665
(Friendship with) a bad man, like a vessel of earth, is easily broken and cemented with difficulty; while (that with) a good man is like a pot of gold, difficult to be broken and easily re-united. Moreover,
; 0668
The union of metals is due to their fluxibility, of beasts and birds to some cause, of fools to fear or (the prospect of) gain, while of good men to (mere) sight. Also,
; 0671
Friends appear to be of the form of coconuts (rough and rugged to outward appearance but sweet at heart): others are like jujubes -- attractive from outside only.
; 0674
Although friendship be at an end, the qualities (behaviour) of good men suffer no change: even when lotus-stalks are broken, the fibres remain sticking (to them) yet. And again
; 0677
Purity (of purpose), generosity, courage, sameness of behaviour in pleasure or pain, politeness, affection and truthfulness -- those are the characteristics of a (true) friend.

;hitoeng021.txt
; 0679
And what other friend than yourself, endowed with these qualities, can I find ? Hearing these his words and such others, Hiranyaka stepped out and said --
; 0681
I am exhilarated by this nectar of your speech (lit. I am fattened by you by &c.); as it is observed :
; 0682
Not a bath with very cool water, not a necklace of pearls, not (even) sandal-wood-pigment applied to each and every limb, delights a man, oppressed with heat, so much, as the words of the good, uttered with affection, advanced with wise arguments (or full of wise thoughts) and comparable to (fascinating like) the charm of attraction, have power over (are able to gratify) the mind of the virtuous. Again, 
;-98. 
[Page 18]
; 0687
 Divulging a secret, begging, hard-heartedness, fickleness of mind, anger, faithlessness and gambling --these are the faults in a friend.
; 0689
Following the order of (the faults mentioned in) this speech, not a single fault is found in you. For,
; 0690
Cleverness and truthfulness are known in the course of conversation; while activity and absence of rashness are known from actual experience. Moreover,
; 0693
Of quite a different sort (from that of a deceitful person) is the friendship of one whose mind is pure: while quite in a different direction (from real action) proceed the words of one whose mind is affected with deceit.
; 0695
There is one thing in mind, another in speech and a third in deed of the vile-minded, while there is one thing in mind, the same in speech and the same in action of the magnanimous.
; 0697
Therefore let your wish be done. Having said so, Hiranyaka formed friendship with the crow, pleased him with choice eatables and entered his hole. The crow, too, repaired to his residence. Thenceforward the two passed their time in making presents of food to each other, in inquiries after good health and in confidential discourses.
; 0701
Once Laghupatanaka said to Hiranyaka -- Friend, it is very hard to get food in this place. I wish, therefore, to go to some other place. 
; 0715
Hiranyaka said  -- Where can we go to? For it is said
A talented man walks with one foot, and stops with the other: 
one should not leave one's old abode without examining carefully the new one.

;hitoeng022.txt
; 0717
The crow said–There is a place well examined. Hiranyaka asked—'Which is that?' The crow replied: There is a lake called Karparagaura in the Dandaka forest. There dwells a pious tortoise, who is my dear friend, acquired a long while ago. For,
; 0723
To be wise in giving advice to others is a thing very easy for all to do; but to be true to the discharge of one's proper duties (or, to discharge ono's duties as required by religion) belongs to some magnanimous soul (only). He will entertain me with choice dainties. Hiranyaka too said--And what am I to do by staying here? For,
; 0727
One should abandon that country in which one cannot command respect, has no means of livelihood, no relatives, and no (possibility) of acquiring knowledge of any kind. Also,
; 0732
One should not reside in a country where there is a lack of these five, viz., subsistence, dread (of authority ), sense of shame, politeness, and charitableness.
; 0736
One should not dwell there, O friend, where these four things do not exist, viz., a creditor, a physician, a Brahmana versed in the Vedas and a river with water (ever flowing).
; 0738
Therefore, take me there too. 
; 0740
Then the crow arrived at the lake with ease conversing on diverse subjects with that friend of his. Then Manthara, having seen them from a distance, addressed a fitting welcome to Laghupatanaka and received the mouse with hospitality due to a guest. For,
; 0744
Let a boy or an old man or a young man come to the house, respect should be shown to him; a guest is the object of worship everywhere. 
;-108. 
[Page 19]

The crow said -- Friend Manthara, do him special honour. For he is the king of mice, Hiranyaka by name, foremost of those whose actions are meritorious and an ocean of mercy. The king of serpents, aided by his twice thousand tongues even, will not be able to sing the praise of his merits. Having said so he described the episode about Chitragriva. Manthara having respectfully entertained Hiranyaka said -- Good friend, kindly relate the cause of your coming to a dreary wood. Hiranyaka said--I will; may you listen. 
FABLE IV. 
; 0760
There is a convent of recluses in the city of Champaka. In it dwelt a hermit, Chudakarna by name. He was in the habit of sleeping after having hung on a peg his alms-pot, containing

;hitoeng023.txt

the remnant of the food collected by begging after he had eaten of it. 
; 0763
I used every day to leap up and eat that food. After some time a dear friend of his, Vinakarna by name, a hermit, came there. While engaged in conversation with him Chudakarna kept beating the ground with an old bamboo stick. Vinakarna said-Friend, why do you take no interest in my story and are busy with something else? Chudakarna replied -- Friend, not that I am indifferent (to your conversation ), but look at this mouse, doing wrong to me, who by jumping up always eats the food collected by me by begging and placed in that pot. Vinakarna, having looked at the peg, observed -- How can a mouse, possessed of little strength, jump to such a height? There must be some reason for this.

The young wife, having suddenly drawn her old husband by the hair, kissed him with a close embrace; there must be some reason for this.
;** end not in hitopadesha-slp1
Chudakarna demanded how it was, whereupon Vinakarna related--
FABLE V.
There is, in the country of Gauda, a city, Kausambi by name. In it dwelt a merchant of great wealth, Chandanadasa by name. Although in the decline of age, he through the pride of wealth, and his mind being full of passion, married merchant's daughter, Lilavati by name. She attained youth, looking like the victorious banner of the god of love; while that aged husband did not please her. For,
The heart of women delights not in a husband whose limbs are worn out by old age, as does not that of men pinched with cold in the (rays of the) moon, or that of men oppressed with heat in the sun. Moreover, 110.
What passion can men have, when the hair even is turned grey, since women, whose heart is set on others, regard it as medicine? However, that old husband had a very great affection for her.
The lust of wealth and the desire for life of men is ever great; but to an old man a youthful wife is dearer than his life.
An old man is not able to enjoy pleasures or to abandon them either: as a dog without teeth simply licks a bone with his tongue (but does not throw it off).
;hitoeng024.txt


Now that Lilavati, transgressing the bounds of family honour througb flush of youth, became attached to a certain merchant's son. For, 
[Page 20]
Unrestrained ) liberty, residence in the father's house
(after the consummation of marriage), meeting with persons on occasions of festive gatherings, a loose living in the vicinity of men, meeting in a company, dwelling in a foreign country, association with women of bad character, constant violation of one's proper conduct, the old age of the husband or his jealousy or his absence in a foreign land--these are the causes of the ruin of a woman's character. Moreover,
Drinking, the company of bad men, separation from the husband, rambling about wantonly, and sleeping and residing in another's house—these six spoil a woman.
* * * * Moreover,
There is no (suitable) place, or leisure or a suitor; it is on account of this that women remain chaste.
Women are ever inconstant, as it is well known even to the gods: happy are those by whom even such are guarded.
There is none who is disagreeable to women; nor is there one who is loved by them; they ever seek a fresh man, as cows do grass in a forest. Again,
A woman resembles a pot of ghee, while a man is like live charcoal: a wise man should not, therefore, keep together the two. - 120.
Not modesty, not good breeding, not rectitude, not timidity, but absence of a suit is the cause of a woman's chastity.
The father guards a woman in childhood, the husband in youth and the son in old age: a woman is not allowed liberty (in any case ).
Once, as that Lilavati was sitting at ease on a couch fringed with the rays of a series of gems, engaged in a confidential talk with the merchant's son, she be held her husband come there unexpectedly, when, rising quickly, she pulled him by the hair, closely embraced him and kissed him. In the meanwhile, the gallant made his escape.
It is said,
The Sastra which Usanas ever knew, as also that which Brihaspati knew,—all that is well planted in the talent of a woman.
;hitoeng025.txt

Seeing that embrace a procuress that stood by said to herself "She has embraced him all of a sudden!' Then that procuress, having ascertained the cause, punished that Lilavati with a secret fine. Hence I say The youthful wife having suddenly seized her old husband &c.' There must be some cause in this case which keeps up the strength of this mouse. After a moment's thought the recluse said-And the cause must be abundance of money. For,
In this world every man of wealth is, everywhere and at all times, powerful; even the supreme power of kings has
wealth for its cause.
[Page 21]
Then he took a spade and having dug out my burrow, took away my long-hoarded wealth. Thenceforward, deprived of my strength, without spirit and energy, and unable to earn even my own food, I was observed by Chudakarna, moving along slowly and with trepidation. Then he observed--
In this world a man becomes powerful by wealth, and by wealth also he becomes (is considered) learned. Look at this wicked mouse reduced to the level of his kind. Moreover,
All the actions of a man of little intellect, if void of wealth, die away (prove fruitless) like small streams in summer.
Again,
He who has wealth has friends; he who has wealth has kinsmen; he who has wealth is a man in this world, and he who has wealth is a learned man. Also,
The house of the sonless is void, and so is of one who has no good friend; all the quarters are void to a fool, but all is void to poverty. And again,
His limbs uninjured are the same; his name is the same ; his intellect unimpaired is the same; his words the same; and the man also the same; and yet, when deprived of the warmth of money, he becomes quite a different man in a moment; this is strange!
Having heard all this I thought to myself:--Now my residence here is improper; and as to my communicating this matter to another, that too is not proper. For,
A wise man should not give out the loss of wealth, mental anxiety, the misdeeds in the house, his being deceived and his humiliation. Moreover, - 130.
;hitoeng026.txt

(The period of) life, (the amount of) wealth, a family secret, charms, conjugal enjoyment, medicine, penance, charity and one's disgrace--these nine things should be carefully concealed.
And so it is said
When fate is extremely adverse, and exertions and valour have been of no avail, where, except in a wilderness, can a highminded man, reduced to poverty, find relief? Moreover,
A man of self-respect will rather die than stoop to meanness (act meanly): fire will even suffer extinction, but never become cool. Moreover,
The course of action of a wise man, like that of a bunch of flowers, is twofold, viz., either to stand at (on) the head of all, or to die (wither) away in a forest.
And as to living here on alms, that would be exceedingly despicable. For,
It were better for a poor man to satisfy fire with his life than to solicit a mean person, lost to all civility.
From poverty a man comes to have shame : overwhelmed with shame he loses moral fortitude: with his moral fortitude lost he suffers contempt; being contemned he feels dejected: full of dejection he comes to sorrow; when overcome with sorrow he is forsaken by reason; with his reason gone, he passes on to destruction: Want of wealth, alas, is the abode of all misfortunes !! Again,
Better is silence observed than an untrue word spoken : better is impotency for men than intercourse with another's wife: better to abandon life than to have a liking for the words of the wicked; better to live on alms than to have the happiness of enjoying another's wealth.
[Page 22]
Better to have an empty cow-pen than a naughty ox; better to have a courtesan for wife than an immodest (ill-trained) woman of family; better a residence in a foreat than in the city of a thoughtless king; better is the abandonment of life than approaching the base (with a request). Moreover,
As service destroys all self-respect, moonlight darkness, old age beauty, the stories about Hari and Hara sin, so does beggars destroy even a hundred good qualities.

;hitoeng027.txt

Having reflected thus (said I to myself)-What then? Shall I support myself with another's cake? O hard lot! That too, would be a second door of death.
Superficial learning, sexual enjoyment obtained by payment, and dependence on others for one's bread-these three are humiliations to men. - 140.
A sick man, one in long exile, one eating another's food, and one sleeping (living) in the house of another the life which such a man lives is as good as ) death, while death is rest to him.
Although I considered thus, yet, from avarice, I made up my mind to hoard wealth. For it is said,
Judgment is led astray (warped) by avarice; avarice begets desire; and a man troubled by desire meets with misery both here and hereafter.
Then as I moved about gently I was struck with an old bamboo-stick by that Vinakarna, whereupon I reflected--A covetous man who is (ever) discontented is certainly a traitor to himself. For,
All riches are his whose mind is contented: is not the earth overspread with leather (at it were) to him whose feet are covered with shoes? Again,
How can that happiness, which is enjoyed by the tranquil-minded, who are satisfied with the nectar of contentment, be theirs, who, attracted by the (lust of) wealth, run here and there? Moreover,
All has been studied, heard and put into practice by him, by whom, having cast behind all desires, contentment (lit. freedom from desire) has been resorted to. Again,
Blessed is the life of some one (rarely to be found) in which the door of the rich has not been attended, in which the pain of separation has not been experienced and in which piteous words have not been uttered. For,
Even a hundred Yojanas (800 miles) are no distances to him who is troubled (spurred on) by thirst; while he, who is content, has no regard even for a thing that is actually in his hand.
It will be advisable, therefore, to decide what to do under the present circumstances.

;hitoeng028.txt

What is a man's (true) duty in this world? Compassion to creatures. What is (real) happiness? Health (lit. freedom from disease). What is affection? Good feeling. And
what is wisdom? Decision. Similarly,
[Page 23]
When misfortunes assail (a man), wisdom lies in (quickly) coming to a decision; misfortunes at every step overtake those who cannot arrive at a decision. Moreover,
One should abandon one person to save a family, a family to save a village, and a village to save a country; but for the sake of one's own self, one should abandon the whole world, Again, - 150.
Of the two--water obtained with ease (lit. without trouble) and delicious food attended with fear, on consideration, I find, indeed, that to be conducive to happiness, wherein lies ease.
Having thus reflected I came to a dreary forest. For,
Better is a forest, haunted by tigers and lordly elephants, wherein the trees serve as a home, ripe fruits and water as food, grass as a bed and barks as garments, than a life without wealth among relatives.
Then by the manifestation of the fruit of my religious merit, I was favoured with friendly intercourse by this friend. And now, by a further continuation of merit, I have got your company, which is heaven itself. For,
Of the poisonous tree of worldly existence, two fruits only have a flavoury juice (are sweet); viz. the testing of the nectar of poetry and the society of the good.
Manthara said--
Riches are comparable to (as unsteady as) the dust of the feet; youth flies away with the rapidity of a mountain river; life is as fleeting as a rolling drop of water, and existence as evanascent as foam; (such being the case) he, who, with his judgment deprived, does not perform his religious duties, which unfasten the bolt of the gate of heaven, being overtaken by old age and full of contrition, is burnt by the fire of sorrow.
[Page 24] 
You laid up too large a hoard; and this ill consequence was the result of that. Hear,
To spend in charity is just to save the money that is acquired, as an outlet is, in the case of water stored up in the bowels of a tank, (the only way to preserve it in a good condition). Moreover,

;hitoeng029.txt

29
Since a miser buries his wealth, deeper and deeper in the earth, he makes a passage for it, beforehand, to go to its nether abode (to disappear in the bowels of the earth). Again,
He who wishes to acquire wealth denying comfort to himself (at the sacrifice of personal comfort) is simply an abode of trouble like one bearing burdens for others. And again,
If people are to be considered rich for possessing wealth which is not used in charity or enjoyment, why should we not consider ourselves rich by the same? Also,
A miser's wealth, inasmuch as it is not used, is the common property of others; the fact that it belonged to him is known by the sorrow caused when it is lost.
A gift accompanied with sweet words, knowledge without vanity, courage attended by forbearance, and wealth spent in charity: these four are rare in this world. It is also said, - 160
A hoard should always be made, but not too great a one; Lo ! The jackal that was in the habit of hoarding was killed by a bow.
The two asked how that was. Manthara related--

FABLE VI.
There was a hunter, Bhairava by name, residing in the province of Kalyana. He, one day, went to the Vindhya forest in search of a deer. As he passed carrying the deer that he had killed, he saw a boar of a formidable form. Then the hunter placed the deer on the ground and wounded the boar with an arrow. The boar too, having set up a deep and dreadful cry (or, a cry as terrible as the thunder of clouds ) struck the hunter in the groin, upon which he fell down like a tree struck down. For,

The man will last for a month, and the deer and the boar for two more: the serpent will serve me (as food for) a day while the bow-string should be eaten to-day.
Let me, therefore, at the first impulse of hunger, eat the unsavoury string made of sinews attached to the bow. When Dirgharava had done so after having thus reflected, he being pierced in the breast by the bow which flew up as soon as the string was cut into two, perished.

Then Laghupatanaka, looking to a great distance, found that no one that would cause fright was coming. Then in pursuance of his words all of them again joined company and sat just there. Manthara said--Good, O deer, you are welcome. You are at liberty to enjoy provisions such as water and the like. Do you favour the forest with your residence here (lit,, let the forest have a master by your residence here). Chitranga said, I who was alarmed by the hunters have come to you for protection and desire your friendship.

Your Honour, therefore, should live here as if in your own house (Make yourself quite at home here ). Upon hearing this, the deer was delighted and having eaten at pleasure and drunk water sat in the shade of a tree that grew near the water. Now Manthara asked-Friend deer, by whom were you
frightened in this desolate wood? What, are there huntsmen

The deer replied in the country of Kalinga there is a king, Rukmangada by name.

And a rumour is heard from the mouth of sportsmen that to-morrow he is sure to come and take his residence near the Karpura lake. So having regard to the fact that our residence here to-morrow is beset with danger, do what the time demands. Hearing that the tortoise said in terror-I will make for another pool. The crow and the deer, too, said-Let it be so. Then Hiranyaka said smilingly-It will be all well with Manthara when another lake is reached, but what means of protection has he while crawling along the ground ? For,

Friend Laghupatanaka, this advice will lead to a result
like this.
You will fare like the merchant's son who became unhappy on beholding with his own eyes his wife's breasts hard pressed
They asked-How was this ? Hiranyaka related
FABLE VII.
There was, in the country of Kanyakubja, a king whose name was Virasena. He appointed a prince, named Tungabala, governor of the city of Virapura. Possessed of great wealth and young, he, while walking about, one day, in his city, saw a young merchant's wife, Lavanyavati by name, who was in the very prime of youth. On returning to his palace with a heart disturbed by love, he sent a messenger for her. For,
So long only does a man keep to the path of virtue, has control over his senses, feels shame and clings to modesty, as the arrows in the shape of glances cast by sportive ladies, discharged after being drawn from the bows of their eyebrows, which reach the region of the ear, which have the dark eyelashes (for feathers) and which rob one of courage, do not fall on his breast.
That Lavanyavati too, from the moment she saw him, thought solely of him, her heart being deeply wounded by the fallings of the shafts of love. For, it is said
Infidelity, a spirit of adventure, deceit, jealousy, extreme avarice, absence of good qualities and want of purity--these are the natural defects of women.
[Page 29]
Now on hearing the words of the go-between Lavanyavati said--I am devoted to my husband. How shall I then think of doing this irreligious deed of being faithless to my husband? For,
She is a wife who is diligent in the management of the household ; she is a wife who is prolific in children; she is a wife who loves her husband as her own life, and she is a wife who is solely devoted to her husband.
She should not be called a wife in whom the husband does not delight: when the husband is pleased, all the deities are pleased with women.

;hitoeng035.txt


Therefore, whatever the lord of my life orders me to do, I do without questioning (its propriety). The messenger asked--Is this the truth? Lavanyavati replied--Beyond doubt this is the truth. Then the messenger went back and reported all that to Tungabala. Having heard it Tungabala observed--How can this be possible that the husband would bring her here and offer her to me? The go-between said--Let a device be used. For it is said--
That which can be achieved by means of a device cannot be accomplished by valour: An elephant was killed by a jackal going over a miry way. The prince asked how it was. She related--

There was an elephant, named Karpuratilaka in Brahmaranya. On seeing him all the jackals thought to themselves--if by some means this can die, his body will afford us sufficient food for four months. Then an old jackal from among them declared I will bring about his death by the power of my intellect. Then the wily fellow having gone to Karpuratilaka and bowed to him touching the ground with the eight parts of his body said--My lord, favour me with a glance. The elephant asked--Who art thou? Whence art thou come? He replied--I am a jackal and sent to Your Honour's presence by all the inhabitants of the forest having assembled together (to say):--Since it is not expendient to live without a king Your Honour has been selected, as possessed of all kingly qualities, to be installed king of the forest.

Your Majesty, therefore, should be so pleased as to come quickly that the auspicious moment may not be lost. Having said so he rose up and went away. Thereupon that Karpuratilaka, drawn by the lust of a kingdom and running by the way taken by the jackal, got stuck in deep mud. Then the elephant said--Friend, jackal, what should be done now? I am plunged in mud and shall perish. Just turn back and look at me. 
; 1099
The jackal replied with a smile, My lord, take hold of my tail and get up. Since you placed confidence in the words of one like me, suffer the misery for which there is no help. For, it is said
; 1102

Then by the advice of the procuress the prince engaged the young merchant, named Charudatta, as servant. Afterwards he was employed by him in the most confidential affairs.
One day the prince, having bathed and anointed himself and put on gold and jewel ornaments said–-From to-day I have to observe a vow in honour of Gauri which will last for a month. Bring me, therefore, every night, a young woman of a noble family. I shall have to worship her in due form. Thereupon that Charudatta brought and presented a youthfal damsel as described and remaining concealed watched how he acted. That Tungabala too, without touching the young lady, offered her worship from a distance with garments, ornaments and fragrant unguents and sent her away with a guard. Now the young merchant, full of confidence at what he had seen, and his mind biased by avarice, brought his own wife Lavanyavati, and presented her. That Tungabala too, knowing that she was Lavanyavati, the darling of his heart, rose up in a hurry, embraced her firmly and with his eyes closed (in joy ) sported with her on a sofa.

Disregarding those words of friendly counsel, and distraught with great fear, Manthara left the pool and set out for another.

On seeing him he picked him up, and fastened him to his bow, and troubled by thirst and hunger brought on by the fatigue of his wandering about, set out homeward.

Having thus lamented much, Hiranyaka said to Chitranga and Laghupatanaka--Before this hunter departs from the forest let an effort be made to deliver Manthara. Tell us, said they, what we are to do. Hiranyaka said--Let Chitranga go to the water-side and feign himself to be dead. Let the crow sit upon him and peck at him with his bill in some way. Surely the sportsman, eager for the deer's flesh, will quickly make for him, leaving the tortoise there. Then I will gnaw
asunder Manthara's bonds. When the sportsman approaches

you, you should run away. When Chitranga and Laghupatanaka had quickly acted as they had been instructed, the huntsman, who being fatigued had drunk water and sat under a tree,

noticed the deer in that condition.

Then delighted at heart, he took up his scissors and went towards him. In the meanwhile, Hiranyaka came and cut off Manthara's bonds, and the tortoise quickly entered the pond. The deer seeing the huntsman approach him started up and bounded away. When the hunter, having returned, came to the foot of the tree and saw not the tortoise there, he thus reflected--This is but meet in the case of me who have acted rashly. For,

; 1175
A great friendship, that was growing between a lion and a bull in a forest, was destroyed by a wily and very ambitious jackal.
; 1177
The princes asked--How was this? Vishnusarma related–-There is in the southern country a city Suvarnavati by name. In it dwelt a merchant named Vardhamana. Although in the possession of a large fortune, yet, seeing that his relatives were very opulent, he thought of again adding to his wealth. For,
; 1182
The greatness of what man that looks lower and lower (i. e. looks upon himself as a very small man or looks at those who are in a humbler station) does not increase? But every one who looks higher and higher (i. e. considers himself as very great, or turns his eyes upon those who are in a higher station) becomes poor. Moreover,
[Page 33]
; 1185
A man who has abundant wealth, although he be a Brahmana-killer, is respected; while one, although claiming a pedigree as noble as that of the moon, is despised, if without wealth. Again,
The goddess of wealth does not wish to embrace (favour) him who is not industrious, who is lazy, who trusts in fate and who is not enterprising, as a young woman does not an old husband. Also,
; 1191
Idleness, attendance on women, a diseased state, a fond partiality for one's native place, contentment, and cowardliness are the six impediments to greatness. For,
; 1194
When a man considers himself as happily situated, even with little wealth, Fate, I think, having done its duty, does not increase that wealth of his. Moreover,
; 1196
May not a woman bring forth such a son as is without energy, joy, and valour, and is a source of delight to his enemies. It is also said,

One should desire to obtain that which is unobtained, keep safe with judicious care what is obtained, properly increase what is preserved, and bestow the same on worthy recipients when it has been increased.

For, if a man does not desire what he does not possess, he makes no exertion for it and remains inactive and does not get it. What is gained, if not properly taken care of, will waste away of itself, although amounting to a nidhi (a vast treasure). Again, wealth, which is not increased, will be reduced to nothing in course of time, although used sparingly like collyrium; and if it be not enjoyed, it is simply useless. As it is said--
; 1206
What is the use of wealth when one neither gives it away nor enjoys it? What is the use of strength when one can do no harm to one's foes? What is the use of the knowledge of scriptures when one does not perform the holy rites? And what is the use of soul when one cannot curb the senses?

another stout bull, fastened him to the yoke of the cart and journeyed on. Thereafter Samjivaka too, having supported his weight on three legs, rose up. For,

Life (when one is to live longer) preserves safe the vitals of one although plunged into the ocean or fallen from a mountain or bitten by the deadliest of cobras.
; 1236
Although pierced with hundreds of arrows, a creature will not die out of his time (of death); but when his time has arrived he will not live when pierced even with a blade of the Kusa grass.
; 1237
That which is defended by Fate lives, although (otherwise) unprotected, and that which is smitten by fate perishes, although well guarded: one without a protector and left in a desert lives (when protected by fate), while one (doomed to die) does not live in a house, although well taken care of (lit. although efforts be made to save him).
; 1242
Then, as days passed on, Samjivaka, as he feasted and sported at pleasure and roamed through the wood, became sleek and hale in body and bellowed aloud. A lion, Pingalaka by name, lived in that forest, enjoying the pleasures of royalty he had acquired by the might of his arms. For it is said--
; 1246
No coronation ceremony nor any other rite is performed upon the lion by the beasts: but the sovereignty over beasts of him who acquires a kingdom by his prowess is self-existent.

; 1248
Once the lion being troubled by thirst went down to the bank of the Yamuna to drink water. There he heard the bellowing of Samjivaka like the unseasonable roaring of clouds and such as he had never heard before. Hearing that he turned back with a start without drinking water, and, having returned to his abode, stood silent, pondering what it could mean. He was observed in that condition by two jackals, named Karataka and Damanaka, the sons of his minister. Seeing him in that situation, Damanaka said to Karataka-Dear Karataka, why is it that our lord, although thirsty, has not drunk water but stands still, dazed and alarmed? Karataka replied--Friend Damanaka, he is not served at all according to our counsel (or, according to my advice he should not be served at all). If that is the case, what is the good of our observing his doings?

For, we, who have been long despised by this king without any fault of ours, have suffered great anguish.
; 1260
See what servants who wish to acquire wealth by means of service have done :—those fools have allowed even the independence of their body to be lost! Moreover,
; 1263
A wise man will practise penance and be happy with even a portion of those sufferings caused by cold, wind and heat which those who are dependent on others undergo. Again,
; 1266
The fruitfulness of life lies in this much, that one lives a life of independence: if those who are in a state of dependence (be said to) live, then, who are the dead ?
; 1269
Come, go away, fall down, rise, speak, observe silence--thus do the wealthy sport with those who are in the grip of the evil spirit of desire.
; 1272
Fools, like harlots, for the sake of self, deck their persons again and again and make them subservient to others. Again,
; 1275
Servants esteem highly even that glance of their master which is naturally unsteady and falls even on an impious person. Another consideration is this--
; 1278
If he (a servant) is silent, he is considered to be) stupid; if clever in talking, crazy-headed or garrulous; if forbearing, timid, if he does not bear tamely, mostly he is (set down as) not well-born; if he stands by the side of his master), he is audacious; but if he stands at a distance, he is not bold: the duties of servitude are extremely abstruse-not to be known even by sages having mystic powers. More especially,
[Page 36]
1283
He bends down that he should rise, sacrifices life that he should live, and exposes himself to misery that he should be happy--who else is a fool than a servant?
; 1285
Damanaka said--Friend, you should not entertain such a thought even in the mind. For,
; 1286
How are great kings not to be served with effort (diligence), who, when pleased, grant desires in a short time? (i.e. they must be served by all means). Consider this much more--
; 1289
Whence can those, who are out of service, have riches with chamaras waved over them, a white umbrella with a prominent staff and a train of servants with horses and elephants?
; 1291
Karataka replied-Still what have we to do with this affair? For, one should by all means avoid meddling with affairs with which one has nothing to do. See,

He, who wishes to meddle with matters which are not business of his, lies dead on the ground like the monkey that pulled out the wedge.

; 1295
Damanaka asked-How was this? Karataka said--
FABLE I.
; 1298
In a place near the holy forest in the country of Magadha, a certain man of the writer class, Subhadatta by name, was having a convent built. A carpenter had put a wedge between the two split-up parts of a beam which was being cut with a saw and which was cleft to some length. A troop of apes came there prancing about. One of the apes, as if urged by Death, caught hold of the wedge with his hands and sat there, 
; begin not in hitopadesha-slp1
while his lower parts hanging down entered the split between the two pieces of the wood. 
; end not in hitopadesha-slp1
; 1304
Then through the mischievous spirit natural to his species, he drew out the wedge with great effort. As soon as the wedge was pulled out, those parts were squeezed and he perished. Hence I say–He who wishes to meddle with matters &c. Damanaka said-Still a servant ought to watch the actions of his master. Karataka replied--Let the prime minister who has charge of all affairs do it. For, a servant must, under no circumstances, interfere with (lit, sit in discussion over) another's business. See,
; 1312
He, who interferes with another's business with a view to serve his master's good, comes to grief like the ass that was beaten for braying.
; 1314
Damanaka inquired how it was and Karataka thus went on--
[Page 37]
FABLE II.
; 1317
In Varanasi dwelt a washerman, named Karpura-pataka. One day, he, having sported for a long time with his young wife, slept soundly. Thereafter a robber got in with the object of stealing the things in the house. In his court-yard there were a donkey tied down and a dog sitting. Now the ass said to the dog-Friend, this is properly your office. Why don't you then rouse the master by barking aloud? The dog replied--Friend, you should not meddle with my business. Don't you yourself know that I guard his house day and night? Since he has been happy for a long time he does not know of what use I am to him and takes but scanty care to feed me. For, unless some danger is in sight masters care but little for their servants.
; 1328
The donkey replied --Hear me, barbarian.

;hitoeng044.txt

He is bad servant and a bad friend (or, is he a servant? is he a friend?) who asks for reward at the time of action (in the hour of need). The dog replied--He is a bad master (or, is he a master?) who speaks sweetly to his servants at the time of need. For,
; 1333
In supporting dependents, in serving a master, in the discharge of religious duties and in begetting a son, substitutes will not do.
; 1335
The donkey said in a rage-O thou evil-minded one, thou art a villain, since thou neglects thy master's business at a critical time. Well, let it be. But I must do that by which my master will wake up. For,
; 1338
One should enjoy the heat of the sun from (by exposing) the back-side, fire by the stomach, a master with all one's heart and soul, and the next world with absence of deceit (a pure heart).
; 1340
With these words, he brayed aloud. Then the washerman, roused by that braying, and angry that his slumbers should have been disturbed, got up and belaboured the donkey with a stick.
; 1343
Hence I say--He who interferes with another's business &c. See-Our office is just to look for game. Let us attend to that. (After reflecting). But we are not concerned with that to-day. For there is plenty of food yet left after what was eaten by us. Damanaka observed angrily--How is it that you serve the king merely for the sake of food? This is unworthy of you. For,
; 1349
The service of kings is desired by the wise that they should be able to do good to their friends and evil to their enemies; (or else) who does not merely fill the belly?
; 1353
Fruitful is the life of him, who living, Brahmaņas, friends, and relations live; for, who does not live for his own self? Moreover,
; 1356
He really lives, who living, many live: does not a crow fill his belly with his bill? Lo!
[Page 38]
Some man becomes a servant for five puranas (a kind of inferior coin), another is satisfied with lacs, while another is not to be had even for lacs. Again,
; 1362
When mankind is all equal, a state of servitude is much to be despised: but is he to be counted among the living who is not first even in that (service)? And in connexion with this, it is said--

;hitoeng045.txt
; 1365
Great is the difference between horses, elephants and metals; between kinds of wood, stones, and garments; and between women, men and water (i.e. between horse and horse &c.) So also,

; 1368
A dog, having obtained a piece of even a fleshless bone soiled with the remnant of a few sinews and narrow, is quite delighted: it does not, however, satisfy his hunger; while the lion, having discarded a jackal though come to his lap, kills an elephant: every man, although reduced to straits, desires a reward befitting his valour (or worth).
; 1372
Moreover, mark the difference between one deserving to be served and (one fit to be) a servant.
; 1373
Wagging the tail, falling down at the feet and lying on the ground exhibiting the mouth and the belly-all this the dog does before his master; but the lordly elephant looks on patiently and eats with hundreds of coaxing words (addressed to him).
Again,
1378
Those who know it (i. e. what life is) call that, indeed, life which is gloriously lived by men although for a moment, and which is invariably attended with knowledge, exploit and fame: (otherwise) a crow also lives for a long time and eats an oblation,
Again,
[Page 39]
; 1383
What is the use of the life of him in the world of men who does not show pity to his son or to his preceptor, to his servants or to a poor man or to his relations? A crow also lives long and eats oblations. Also this--
; 1388
What difference is there between a beast and a human beast whose intellect is void of the power of discriminating between good and bad, who sets at naught most of the rules of conduct enjoined by the sruti and whose only desire is to fill up his belly?
; 1392
Karataka said--As for us, we are subordinates. This being the case, why should we busy ourselves with this matter? Damanaka replied--In what space of time (i. e. in a short time if they have the ability) do ministers become principal or sub ordinate ? For,
; 1396
No one in this world is generous towards, beloved by or wicked to another: it is a man's own actions alone that lead him to greatness or to the reverse (i. e. man is the architect of his own fortune). Also,

; 1401
Just as a stone is raised to the top of a hill with great efforts but hurled down in a moment, so is the soul led to virtue or vice.

It is by his actions that a man sinks lower and lower, or rises up like the digger of a well or the builder of a wall.
; 1405
Therefore, friend, a man's position (lit. soul) depends on his exertions. Karataka said--Now what do you say? He replied--This our lord Pingalaka has come back frightened at something or other and has sat down. Karataka asked
; not in hitopadesha-slp1
--Do you know the real fact? Damanaka replied--What is there that is not known? It is said--
; 1410
When a thing is expressed in words, even a brute can understand it; even horses and elephants bear (loads) when ordered; a clever man comprehends a meaning although not expressed: for, talent has for its fruit the knowledge of the inward thoughts of others.
; 1414
The inmost thoughts of a man are divined from his features, gestures, movements, actions, speech and the motion of the eyes and the face.

; 1416
Therefore, on this occasion of fear, I will win over this lord by the force of my intellect. For,
; 1418
He is a wise man who knows how to address a speech suited to an occasion, or to act in a manner befitting one's good intention or to be angry in proportion to one's strength.
; 1420
Karataka said--Friend, you do not know how to serve. See,
; 1421
He is a fool who enters (into royal presence) withont being called, speaks much without being asked, and considers himself a favourite of the king.
; 1423
Damanaka said--Friend, how can I be ignorant of serving?
; 1424
Is there anything by nature charming or not charming?
; 1425
Whatever a man likes is charming to him. For,
; 1427
Whatever a man's (thought or) feeling be, having ministered to that, a talented man should quickly win him over.
; 1430
When asked 'who is here' a servant should say 'I; please command'; and he should execute the king's command to the best of his ability. Moreover,
; 1433
He, who is modest in his desires, patient, wise, always in attendance like a shadow and would not hesitate when ordered (to do a thing), should dwell in a king's palace.

;hitoeng047.txt
; 1435
Karataka observed--Perhaps the lord might disregard you for your entrance (into his presence) at an inopportune time. He replied--Let it be so. Still a servant must necessarily be in the presence of his master. For,
; 1438
Not beginning a thing through fear of fault (or, of an ill consequence) is the sign of a coward; who, brother, leaves off taking food for fear of indigestion? See--
; 1441
A king favours (or gets attached to) a man who is near him, whether he be illiterate, low-born or unworthy of association (or, not attached to his master): as a general rule, kings, young women and creepers cling to (lit. twine round) him who is near them.
; 1445
Karataka said--Now going there what will you say? He said--Hear me. In the first place I will ascertain whether the master is attached to me or not. Karataka asked--What is the sign from which this can be known? Damanaka replied--
Listen.
[Page 41]
; 1449
Looking (at one) from a distance, smiling, great regard for inquries about one's welfare, praising the merits even in one's absence: remembering one among objects which are dear, attachment even when one does not serve, making a donation with sweet words and noting one's merits even when one is at fault—these are the signs of a lord well-attached.
;-60. 
; 1453
Again,
; 1454
Delaying, encouraging hopes, but disappointing as to their fulfilment, these a talented man should know to be the signs of a lord ill-disposed.
; 1456
Laying all this to heart I will speak in such a way as to bring him under my power. For,
; 1457 
; translation very far from text
Wise men give us a vivid picture of failure to result from impediments foreseen and a bad use of policy and success resulting from a judicious use of the expedients and the proper employment of policy.
; 1461
Karataka observed—Still you should not speak until you find a proper opportunity. For,
; 1462
Even Brihaspati uttering a speech out of its season will be contemned as one wanting in discrimination and meet with eternal disgrace.
; 1464
Damanaka said--Friend, be not afraid. I shall not speak unseasonably. For,

;hitoeng048.txt
; 1466
A servant having his master's welfare at heart should speak out, unasked, when a calamity is impending, when the master is going astray or when the proper time to do a thing is passing away (when an opportunity is allowed to slip away by his master).
; 1468
And if I were not to give my counsel when there has been an occasion for it, a minister's post would ill become me. For,
; 1470
A man of merits should keep up and foster that quality by which be earns his livelihood and for which he is praised in this world by the good.
; 1472
Therefore, friend, give me your permission. I will go. Karataka said--My blessing to you. May your path be auspicious (i. e. I wish you godspeed). Do as you desire. Damanaka then repaired into Pingalaka's presence like one amazed. Now, being respectfully received into his presence by the king, he prostrated himself before him, touching the ground with the eight parts of the body, and sat down. The king said--You are seen after a long time. Damanaka replied--Although Your Majesty has nothing to do with me as a servant, still a follower must necessarily attend upon his master when the time demands it, and hence have I come here. Moreover, 
[Page 42]
; 1481
Great lords have occasion even for a blade of grass serving as a tooth-pick or as an ear-scratcher: what to say, then, of man who is gifted with speech and hands!
; 1485
And even if my noble lord might suspect that I have lost my mental power being long despised, that, too, should not be done. For,
; Not in hitopadesha-slp1, but in lines 1492-1493

The loss of intellect of a man of fortitude, although oppressed, must not be suspected; the flame of fire though overturned can never proceed downwards.
; 1491
My lord, a master ought to be discriminating (lit. marking the difference between good and bad men; or, must recognize special merit). For,
; See 1492-3 above
; 1495
When a king treats (lit. acts towards) all without distinction, the energy of those who are capable of exertion is lost. Moreover,

Since,
Servants and ornaments ought to be set on their proper places : for, a crest-jewel is not worn on the foot or a foot-ornament on the head. Moreover,
; 1504
If a gem fit to be set in a gold ornament is set on tin, it does not cry, nor does it* not shine there: the person setting it there, however, is exposed to censure. Again,
; 1509
A piece of glass is set in a diadem and a jewel placed in a foot-ornament : the blame does not lie with the gem, but it is the want of discretion on the part of the setter. See,
; 1512
A king who knows how to discriminate between servants--e.g., this is talented, this is attached to me, this is brave, while there is danger from this--is surrounded to fullness by servants. So also,
; 1515
A horse, a weapon, a text of holy law, a lute, speech, a man and a woman, turn out fit or unfit according to the particular man they come in contact with.
; 1518
What is the use of a servant, who, though devoted, is without ability or of one who is able but doing harm?
; 1519
It does not behove you, o king, to despise me, who am both devoted and able. For,
; 1521
By being despised by a king the servants turn out dullheaded; then on account of their predominance no wise man approaches him; when the kingdom is abandoned by wise men, policy does not become efficacious; and policy having failed the 
[Page 43]
whole world falls a helpless victim to misery. Moreover,
; 1526
People always honour the man respected by the king, but he who is despised by the king is slighted by all. And further,
; 1529
Wise men should accept what is well said even by a child; is not the light of a lamp acceptable when (or where) the sun is not shining ?
; 1531
Pingalaka said--Dear Damanaka, why do you talk so? You, the son of our prime minister, did not come here for so long a time believing in the words of some rogue. Now freely say your say. Damanaka said--Lord, I have a question to ask.
* If the reading be 'na cApi sa SoBate', then omit 'not'.

;hitoeng050.txt
; 1535
Please reply. Why does my lord stand here, as if amazed, without drinking water, although thirsty ? Pingalaka replied--You have spoken well. But there is no one trustworthy to whom this secret can be confined. You are such a one. Therefore I will communicate it to you. Listen. This forest has now been inhabited by some beast, unheard of before, and must for that reason, be left by us. I am perplexed on this account. Similarly you too have heard that strange loud sound. Great must be the strength of this animal corresponding to his voice. Damanaka replied--My lord, this is, indeed, a great cause for fear. We too have heard the sound. But he is a bad minister who first counsels the quitting of land and then a fight. At this crisis when it is difficult to know what steps to take, the use of servants alone is to be known. For,
; 1546
A man knows (tests) on the touch-stone of adversity the strength of his relatives, wife and servants, as also of his intellect and mental calibre.

; 1548
The lion said--Friend, a great terror has overtaken me. Damanaka said again-(To himself) How, else, can you talk to me of leaving the pleasures of a kingdom and going to another place. (Aloud) My lord, as long as I am alive, Your Majesty should have no fear. But Karataka and others should also be encouraged (by marks of royal favour), since it is difficult to have a united body of men at the time of overcoming a calamity.
Then Damanaka and Karataka, on whom every honour was bestowed by the king, set out having promised to ward off the danger. On the way Karatake said to Damanaka--Friend, without ascertaining whether the cause of fear is possible to be averted or not, why did you accept this great favour having undertaken the removal of the fear? For unless one has done a service one should not accept a reward from anybody, especially from a king. Observe,
On his (king's) favour depends wealth, on his exploit victory and on his anger death: for he represents all splendours (energies). So also,
A king although a boy, should not be despised because he is a man; for he is a mighty deity existing in a human form.

Damanaka smiled and said--Friend, rest quiet (easy). I have known the cause of fear. That was the bellowing of a

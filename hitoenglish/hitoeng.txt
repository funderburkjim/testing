HITOPADESA
May success attend the good in their undertakings (in the object they wish to accomplish ) by the favour of that Dhurjati, on whose head there is a digit of the moon looking like a streak of the foam of the Ganges.
This Hitopadesa (the work inculcating salutary instruction) when studied (lit., carefully attended to) gives (the student) proficiency in elegant speeches, a variety of expression in every department and a knowledge of the conduct of human affairs.
A wise man should think of (acquiring) knowledge and money as though he were not subject to old age or death: but he should perform his religious duties as if Death had seized him by the hair.
Learning, of all things, (the wise) declare to be without a superior (the best of them all ), because of its incapability of being taken away, or valued or exhausted.
Learning, although possessed by a low man, introduces him to the king who is (ordinarily) inapproachable, just as a river, although flowing through a low region, takes one to the inaccessible sea : (sources) from which floweth great fortune (or, the future rests with fortune).
Learning endows one with modesty ; from (having) modesty one passes on to (gets) worthiness ; being worthy one obtains riches ; from riches religious merit and from that happiness.
The knowledge of arms and that of the Sastras - these two lores conduce to glory: but the former exposes one to ridicule in old age, while the latter is ever respected.
As an impression made upon a raw (earthen or so) pot can undergo no change afterwards -- so (following the same principle) in this work the science of conduct (or policy) is taught to youths under the guise of stories.

On the bank of the Bhagirathi there is a city named Pataliputra. In it there was a king, Sudarshana by name,

;hitoeng002.txt
endowed with all princely qualities. That king once heard &\a couple of Slokas (stanzas) chanted by some one ; (viz.)
He who does not possess a knowledge of) Sastra, the universal eye, which totally removes various doubts and discusses things hidden from view, is surely blind. -10
Youth, abundance of wealth, sovereignty and inconsiderateness are the source of calamity even singly; what then, where all these four are combined ! !
On hearing this, the king, who was distracted at heart, on account of the non-attendance to (the commands of the) Sastras of his sons who had no knowledge of the Sastras and who always followed the wrong path, thought to himself:
What is the good of (what benefit can accrue from) having a son who is neither learned nor pious (dutiful); (for) what is the use of an eye that is blind? It simply causes occular pain.
Of sons, not born, (born and) dead and foolish, the first two are to be preferred and not the last: (for) the first two cause pain (but) once ; the last at every step. Moreover,
He is really) born by whose birth the family is exalted. In this revolving world who does not die and is not born again?
If the mother of the boy, for whom the little finger does not bend down hastily at the commencement of the enumeration of the number of meritorious men, be said to have given birth to a son, then say, what a barren woman would be like to (i.e., she is as good as a barren woman).
He, who is not well known for his charity, penance, bravery, learning and the acquisition of wealth, is but the excrement of his mother. Also,
It is better to have one meritorious son than a hundred of foolish ones; the single moon dispels darkness; and not the whole firmament of stars.
The son of him, who has practised religious austerities, extremely difficult to perform, at some holy place, will be obedient, prosperous, righteous and talented.
An influx of money, constant health (lit., freedom from disease), a beloved wife, and one sweet-speaking (of gentle manners), an obedient son, and learning productive of wealth -- these six, o king, are the pleasures of the mortal world. 
[Page 3]
Who will be (considered) blessed by having sons who are like (no better than, the adhakas* (a kind of measure) filling up
** i.e., Simply making up a particular number.


;hitoeng003.txt

a granary? It is better to have one son, who is the prop of the family and who brings fame to his father. -20
A father who contracts debts (i.e., leaves nothing to his son but a legacy of debt) is an enemy, and so is a mother, false to her bed; a beautiful wife is an enemy; and such is an illiterate son.
Learning if not kept up by constant study is poison ; taking food after indigestion is poison; to a poor man a public assembly is poison; and to an old man a youthful wife is poison.
A man of merits, born of whatevor parents, is honoured ; (for) what is the use of a bow that is without string though made of a faultless bamboo staff (or, what can a man of pure Kshatriya extraction do if wanting in martial vigour)?
Alas! poor child, thou, who leadest an easy life, didst not acquire knowledge in these (bygone) nights, on this account dost thou come to grief (fare ill) in the society of the learned like a cow stuck in mud.
Then how shall I now make my sons accomplished ! For: --
Food, sleep, fear and the enjoyment of carnal pleasures -- these men share in common with beasts ; surely the sense (or performance) of duty is their special attribute (distinguishing mark): devoid of this they are degraded to the level of (stand on a level with) beasts.
The life of him, who has not achieved any one of Dharma (the discharge of religious duties), Artha (the acquisition of money by fair means), Kama (the gratification of desires so as not to trespass on Dharma) and final emancipation, is as without its purpose (useless) as that of the nipple on the neck of a she-goat.
Now, (as to) the declaration (doctrine) that --
(The period of) life, (the kinds of) action (one has to perform), (the amount of) wealth (to be acquired), (the degree of) knowledge (to be attained), and (the time of) death -- even these five are created (determined) while a man is yet in the womb. And that,
Things, which are fated, do happen even in the case of the great: (as) Siva's nakedness aad Hari's having to sleep on a huge serpent. And further,
What is not to be can never be, and if it is to be, it can never be otherwise -- why is this antidote against the poison of anxiety not swallowed ? --

;hitoeng004.txt

These are the idle words of some, incapable of doing anything.
Even thinking fate to be favourable one should not give up one's industry ; (for) one can never get oil from sesamum without exertion. Moreover,
Fortune approaches him, the lion among men, who is industrious. It is the weak-minded who say "Fate gives". Dismissing all idea about (lit., killing) fate, put forth manly efforts depending upon your own strength; and if, after an exertion is made, success attend not, where is the blame (i.e., you are not to blame; or, find out where the fault lay)? 
; 31. 
[Page 4]
 Just as a chariot can not move with one wheel, so without manly exertion, fate does not succeed. And further,
What is called fate is (but) the (sum of one's) actions in a previous life; one should, therefore, make an effort manfully without being slothful.
Just as a potter makes whatever he likes out of a lump of clay, so does a man reap the fruit of the action done by himself.
Even seeing a treasure found quite by accident in front of a man, fate does not take it up itself, but expects a manly effort of his part.
Works are accomplished by industry and not by (idle) wishes; for the deer enter not the mouth of a sleeping lion.
A boy who is educated by his parents becomes accomplished. A son does not become a learned man by merely being dropped out of the womb.
That mother is an enemy and that father a foe of the son by whom he is not taught; for he (such a son) shines not in an assembly just as a crane does not in the midst of swans.
Men, endowed with beauty and youth and born of a very noble race but deficient in learning, do not shine as (do not) the scentless Kimshuka flowers.
Even a fool, dressed in fine garments, shines in an assembly; but he shines only so long as he does not open his lips. 
;- 40.
Having thus meditated the king convened a council of the learned. The King said -- Ye Pandits, listen. Is there such a learned man among you, as is able to make my sons who are always going astray and who are ignorant of the Sastras, undergo a second birth (as it were) by giving them instruction in the science of conduct? For,

;hitoeng005.txt

A piece of glass, by being in contact with gold, possesses the lustre of emerald ; similarly a fool attains proficiency by being in the company of the good. It is also said --
The intellect is impaired, O friend, by the society of inferiors; it remains what it is with one's equals and is improved by association with one's superiors.
Then a great Pandit, Visnusharman by name, who know all the principles of the Science of conduct (or, who knew the very essence of the entire science of conduct) spoke like a second Brihaspati -- My lord, these princes are born of an exalted race. They are, therefore, capable of being instructed by me in the Nitishastra. For,
No action exercised upon an unfit object can bear fruit: a crane cannot be taught (to speak) like a parrot even with hundreds of efforts. And this other thing,
In this (royal) family a child devoid of merits cannot be born; whence can a piece of glass be produced in a mine of rubies ? 
[Page 5]
I will, therefore, make your sons well versed in the Nitishastra within the space of six months. The king spoke again respectfully
Even an insect ascends the head of the good by being in contact with flowers; a stone also attains divinity when well consecrated by the great. Moreover,
As objects on the rising mountain appear bright by the near presence of the sun, so a person of humble rank too shines by being in the company of the good.
Merits pass as merits with those who know how to appreciate them: coming in contact with one devoid of merits they are turned into faults. Rivers, as they rise, have their water sweet, but on reaching the sea they cease to be drinkable. 
; 47
I, therefore, give you Carte blanche as regards giving instruction to my sons in the science of conduct. Having said so the king entrusted his sons to Vishnusharman with great respect.
Now as the princes were sitting at ease on the terrace of their palace the Pandit said before them by way of introduction --
The wise pass their time in amusement derived from (the study of) poetry and Shastra, while fools pass theirs in vicious pursuits, in sleep or in quarrelling.

I will, therefore, relate, for your diversion, the wonderful tale of the crow, the tortoise and others. The princes said -- Sir, tell it. Vishnusharman said -- Listen. I now being Mitralabha of which the following is the introductory verse.

Chapter 1. 
THE ACQUISITION OF FRIENDS. 
Though destitute of means and without wealth, the crow, the tortoise, the deer and the mouse, who were the best of friends and gifted with intellect quickly accomplished their purposes.
The princes asked "How was this ?" Vishnusharma related --
There is, on the bank of the Godavari, a large silk-cotton tree. There, coming from regions in different quarters, birds were wont to roost at night. Once, when the night was almost spent, and the divine Moon, lord of the night-lotus, was pending on the crest of the setting mountain, a crow, Laghupatanaka (Swift-flier) by name, who was awake, saw a fowler advancing like a second god of death. Seeing him he reflected "To-day I have had an unwelcome sight iu the early morning. I know not what evil it forebodes." Saying so he set out, much disturbed at heart, following up his (the fowler's) course. For,
Thousands of occasions for sorrow, and hundreds for fear, day by day, overtake the fool and not the wise man. 
; 3
[Page 6]
 Moreover, worldly people must do this --
Every day on rising, they should think that a great calamity is at hand -- which of death, disease or sorrow would befall (them)! (So that in case of an emergency one should be fore-warned and prepared to meet it).
Now the hunter, having scattered the grains of rice, spread out his net, and himself remained concealed. Just at that time a king of pigeons, Chitragriva (the Speckle-necked) by name, who was sailing in the sky with his retinue, noticed the grains of rice. Then the pigeon-king said to the pigeons that were attracted by the grains of rice -- Whence can there be the possibility of rice-grains being found in this lonely (tenantless) forest? So let the matter be first carefully examined. I do not see any good will come out of this.
Probably, by this our desire for the rice-grains, we too shall fare similarly (meet with a fate similar) to that of --

;hitoeng007.txt

The traveller, who through the lust of a bracelet, sank in deep mire and being caught by an old tiger, lost his life.
The pigeons asked how it was ; whereupon he related --
FABLE 1. 
Once while roaming in the southern forest I saw -- A certain old tiger, having bathed and taken Kusa grass in his paw, used to address (the passers by sitting) on the margin of a lake (thus) -- "Ho, ho, travellers, take this gold bracelet." Then a certain traveller, attracted by greed, thought to himself -- This happens by good luck. But I must not proceed in a matter where there is personal risk. For,
Although a desired object be obtained from an undesirable source, the result is not good ; even nectar (or sweet-food), which is contaminated with poison, leads to death.
But an attempt to get wealth is in every case, attended with peril. And it is said in connection with this --
Without embarking upon an adventure a man does not see good fortune ; but if he does embark upon it and lives (survives it), he sees it.
Let me therefore carefully see it. He said aloud -- "Where is thy bracelet?" The tiger stretched forth bis paw and showed it. The traveller said - How am I to trust thee who art ferocious ? The tiger replied -- Liston, O traveller. Formerly, indeed, in the days of youth, I was extremely wicked. On account of my slaughter of many a cow and man, my sons and wife perishod ; and I am without issue. I was then advised by a holy man to practice charity and do such other holy deeds. Following his counsel, I am now in the habit of bathing and giving gifts ; I am old and have lost my nails and teeth ; how can I not be an object of confidence then! For, 
[Page 7]
 Sacrificing, studying one's prescribed portion (of the Vedas), charity, penance, truthfulness, patience, forgiveness and freedom from avarice -- this is the eightfold way of doing religious duties as laid down in the Smritis. 
; - 8.
Out of these the first four may be practised even for display, while the last four are found in the magnanimous-hearted only.
And so great is my freedom from desire, that I wish to give away, to any body whatsoever, the gold bracelet although secure in my hand. Yet the (indescriminate) talk of the people

;hitoeng008.txt

that a tiger eats men is difficult to be avoided (lit., warded off). For,
People, who are the blind followers of one another, regard not a preaching bawd as an authority in religious matters, as they do a Brahmana although (he happens to be) a cow-killer.
; -10
I, on my part, bave studied the codes of religious law. Hear me.
O son of Pandu, as is a shower of rain to the Maru (desert) land, or food to one afflicted with hunger, so is a gift to the poor, full of fruit.
As life is dear to oneself so it is to (other) creatures. The good show pity to creatures by comparing (them) to themselves. Moreover,
In refusing and giving, in pleasure and pain, and in things (or acts) agreeable and disagreeable, a man knows the standard (of action) by self-comparison. Also,
He, who looks upon another's wife as a mother, another's wealth as a clod of earth, and upon all creatures as his own self, is a (truly) wise man.
You are in hard distress (lit., extremely ill-situated) and hence I am endeavouring to give it to you.
Enrich the poor, O son of Kunti ; bestow not wealth upon the rich; medicine is wholesome to him who is diseased; what need of medicine has he that is whole ? And again,
A gift, which is given for the sake of charity, to one who is not a benefactor (or who cannot make a return for it), and in the proper place, at the proper time and to a proper recipient is, (the sages) consider, a gift of the best sort.
Therefore, bathe in this lake and accept this gold bracelet. Thereupon, placing confidence in his words, no sooner did the traveller enter the lake for bathing than he stuck in deep mud and was unable to run away. The tiger seeing him plunged into the mire said -- Ha, thou art fallen into deep mud. I will lift thee out of it. Saying so he approached him gently : and the traveller being seized by the tiger reflected --
That he reads the texts of religious law or studies the Vedas, is no reason why confidence should be reposed in a villain : it is the nature that predominate in such a case : just as by nature the milk of cows is sweet.

;hitoeng009.txt

Also, the actions of those, whose senses and mind are not under control, are like the bath of an elephant:* knowledge without action is a burden, like feeding an ill-natured (lit. unlucky) woman or like ornaments on an ugly woman.
[Page 8]
I, therefore, did not do well in that I placed confidence in
this ferocious beast. For, says the precept --
Trust should never be placed in rivers, in persons having weapons in their hands, in animals armed with claws, and horns, as well as in women and royal families.** Again,
It is the natural disposition of every one that is tested, and not his other qualities; for having surpassed all (other) qualities, disposition stands at the head. And further,
; 20
 That well-known sporter in the sky, the destroyer of sin (darkness), possessor of a thousand rays (bands), and marching in the midst of the stars, even he, the Moon, is devoured (eclipsed) by Rahu, by the decree of fate: who is able to efface what is written on the forehead ? 
While thus musing he was killed by the tiger, and eaten.
Therefore I say "Through the last of a bracelet &c." For this reason nothing rash should at all be done. For,
Food well digested, a son very wise (well educated), a wife well disciplined, a king served faithfully, what is spoken after being well thought over and what is done after due consideration -- these do not lead to a bad result even after a very long time.
On hearing these words a certain pigeon said arrogantly -- Ah, why is it so said ?
The words (counsel) of the aged should be acted upon (followed) only when the time of calamity is at hand : if we consider thus in all matters, we can hardly proceed to take our food. For,
Everything on the surface of the earth, food and drink, is involved in doubt: to what should an attempt be directed and how should life be supported ?
One who is envious, one given to reviling, one (ever) discontented, one who is irascible and one who is always suspicious -- these six have misery for their lot.
* Which is useless as the animal is sure to cover his body the next moment with mud.
** (As far as third favour is concerned).

;hitoeng010.txt

; 10
On hearing this the pigeons alighted on (the grains ). For,
Even those, who are masters of the great Shastras, well-informed, and able to remove doubts, experience trouble when (their judgment is) blinded by avarice. Again --
From greed proceeds disquietude, from greed springs up the desire (for pleasures), and from greed result infatuation and (finally) ruin; greed is the root of sin.
And again,
The existence of a gold deer was impossible and yet Rama coveted (such) a deer; as a general rule when (some) calamity is impending the talents of men become clouded. 
; 28
[Page 9]
After that they were all caught in the net. Then all of them began to revile him, by whose advice they had descended there. For,
One should not go at the head of (lead) a multitude; if the undertaking succeeds, the fruit is the same to (equally shared by) all; but if it fails, the leader is killed. 
Hearing how he was reproached, Chitragriva said -- It is not his fault. For,
Of misfortunes about to befall, even a friend becomes the cause: when a calf is to be tied down the leg of the mother serves as a post.
He is a friend of the afflicted who is able to deliver them from misery, and not he, who is clever (only) in condemning a thing ill done or omitted to be done. (With the reading न तु भीत -- clever in finding fault with the manner of protecting the distressed.)
In the time of adversity, perplexity itself is the sign of a weak-minded man. Therefore, taking courage in this case, think out a remedy. For,
Fortitude in adversity and again forbearance in prosperity, eloquence in an assembly and valour on the battle-field, a liking for fame (good name) and a strong attachment to study -- these are the natural possessions of the magnanimous.
A mother rarely gives birth to a son, an ornament of the three worlds, who does not rejoice in prosperity or feel sorrow in adversity and is firm in battle. Moreover,
A man, wishing for welfare in this world, should avoid theee six faults ; viz., sleepiness, slothfulness, timidity, anger, idleness and dilatoriness.

;hitoeng013.txt

Giving up all regard for this perishable body which is made of flesh, urine, ordure, and bones, save my reputation, 0, friend. See,
If lasting and unsullied fame be gained at the expense of the body which is perishable and a vehicle of dirt, what would not be gained ? For,
Very great is the distance that separates the body from the qualities: the body is liable to destruction in a moment, while the qualities endure to the end of the universe.
Having heard this, Hiranyaka, being delighted at heart and with his hair standing on end, said -- Noble, friend, noble ! By this your affection for your followers, you deserve the sovereignty of even the three worlds. With these words, he cut off the bonds of them all. Then Hiranyaka, having cordially received all, said -- Dear Chitragriva, in regard to this your being caught in a net you should not blame yourself by suspecting any fault on your part. For,
That very bird, who sees his prey from a distance of more than a hundred yojanas, sees not the snares (laid for him) when his time has arrived. Moreover, 
;- 50.
When I behold the oppression of the moon and the sun by the monsters (Rahu and Ketu), the imprisonment of even the elephant and the cobra, and the poverty of the talented, I come to think -- Fate, alas, is powerful! And again, 
Even birds moving (or, sporting) in a part of (or exclusively in) the sky meet with calamity; and the fishes, too, are caught by experts from the sea with its unfathomable waters; so what is an evil act or a good one in this world, or of what avail is a position of advantage ? For, the god of destruction, with his hand in the form of a calamity stretched forth, seizes even from afar. 
[Page 12]
 Having thus enlightened him, he entertained him hospitably, embraced him and dismissed him to go; whereupon Chitragriva, with his attendant train, went to the regions he liked to go to. Hiranyaka too entered his burrow.
One should make hundreds of friends, of whatever description they may be: behold, the pigeons were released from bonds by their friend, the mouse.
Now the crow Laghupatanaka, the witness of the whole affair, said this in astonishment: Ho, Hiranyaka, you are

;hitoeng014.txt


praiseworthy. I, therefore, desire friendship with you. Kindly then favour me with your friendship. On hearing this, Hiranyaka asked from within his hole -- who are you? He said I am a crow, Laghupatanaka by name. Hiranyaka smilingly observed -- What friendship can there be with you ? For,
Whatever is fit to be united with another, in this world, the same a wise man should unite with that: I am the food and you the feeder: how can love (friendship) exist between us? And again,
Friendship between the food and its eater is simply the cause of misfortune: the deer that was caught in a snare, through (the stratagem of) a jackal was delivered by a crow. The crow asked -- How was that ? Hiranyaka related -- :

FABLE II. 

There is, in the country of Magadha, a vast wilderness, called Champakavati. In it there long lived in great friendship a deer and a crow. The deer, plump and sleek in body, was spied by a certain jackal, while roaming at will. On seeing him, the jackal said to himself -- Ah, how shall I come by his delicious flesh ! Well, let me first create confidence (in him). Having thus reflected, he went up to him and said -- Friend, is it all well with you? The dear asked -- Who are you? He replied -- I am a jackal, Kshudrabuddhi (Little-wit) by name. I live here, like one dead, having lost all my relatives. Now that I have found a friend in you and have (thus) a relative, I have once more entered the world of the living. Now I will, in every way, be your attendant. The deer said -- Be it so. Thereafter, when the divine Sun, the wearer of a wreath of rays, had set, the two went to the residence of the deer. There on the branch of a Champaka tree, lived a crow, named Subuddbi (Good-wit), an old friend of the deer. Seeing the two the crow asked -- Friend, who is this second ? The deer said -- This is a jackal who comes here desiring our friendship. The crow said, friend, friendship, all of a sudden, with a stranger, is not advisable. For it is said -- 
Shelter should not be given to any one whose family and disposition are not known; for the fault ofa& cat, the vulture, Jaradgava, suffered death.
The two asked how it was, whereupon the crow related --

FABLE III. 

There is a large Parkati tree on the hill, named Gridhrakut (the peak of Vultures), on the bank of the Bhagirathi,

;hitoeng015.txt


In its hollow dwelt, with his talons and eyes gone through an adverse turn of fate, a vultura, Jaradgava by name. Now, out of pity, the birds, roosting in the tree, spared small portions from their food and gave them to him. He lived on that and 
[Page 13]
 looked after the young birds. Now, once a cat, named
Dirghakarna (the long-eared) came there to eat the youngs of the birds. Seeing him coming, the nestlings being terror-stricken, raised a cry. Hearing it Jaradgava asked -- Who is this that is coming? Dirghakarna, seeing the vulture, said in alarm -- Alas, it is all up with me. However,
One should dread a danger only as long as it has not arrived; but seeing that the danger has come, a man should do what the occasion demands,
Now that I am in his presence, I cannot run away. So let things take what course they may. I will first create confidence in him and then approach him. Thus resolved, he went forth and said -- Sir, I salute you. The Vulture asked -- Who are you? He replied -- A cat. The Vulture said -- Get away, else I shall have to kill yon. The cat said -- In the first place, hear me, and then, if you deem me to be worthy of death, let me not live. For,
Is any one killed or honoured merely because he belongs to a particular caste? It is only on one's actions (conduct) being fully known that one is found fit to merit death or respect.
The Vultore said –- Explain why you have come here. The cat replied -- I dwell here on the bank of the Ganges, bathing every day, living a life of celibacy and practising the vow of Chandrayana. All birds, worthy of confidence, always declare before me that you are devoted to the study of religious law. Hence did I come here to hear from you, who are advanced both in knowledge and years (lit. old both as regards krowledge and age), the holy law. But your honour is so well versed in that law that you are ready to kill me, a guest. While the duty of a house-holder is this --
Fitting hospitality should be shown even to a foe coming to the house: the tree withdraws not its shade from its cutter.
And if there be no wealth, a guest should be honoured with kind words at least. For,
Grass (a seat made of grass), place, water and the fourth (thing), agreeable speech, these, at any rate, are never refused in the house of the good. Moreover,
